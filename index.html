        <h1>What is SHO</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>SHO stands for <strong>SchoolHeadOffice.co.za</strong>, a CRM app for schools, parents, and the community. It simplifies school management and enhances the educational experience for everyone involved.</p>
        
        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>SchoolHeadOffice.co.za was originally started in 2016 under the name <strong>SchoolSPUN.com</strong>. The goal was to create a platform that could streamline the administrative tasks of schools while also engaging parents and the community in the educational process. SchoolSPUN.com offered various features that allowed users to raise money through donations for their children in school. It also enabled schools to directly raise funds from community members online with just a few clicks.</p>
        <p>In 2024, after recognizing the potential for a more comprehensive solution, SchoolSPUN.com was rebranded as <strong>SchoolHeadOffice.co.za</strong>. The new name reflects our broader vision of providing a centralized platform for school management. We retained the popular features of SchoolSpun, such as the donation-raising capabilities, and integrated them into a more advanced CRM system. This evolution allowed us to create a solution that addresses the daily activities and needs of schools and parents in a single app.</p>
